# Emotion-Based-Music-Player  üéµ

* An emotion recognition system that first analyzes the facial sentiments of the user and then suggests songs to them.

* Humans have the general mentality of listening to that genre of music which emotion they are feeling. The song playlists though are too big to sort out automatically. It would be helpful if the music player was ‚Äúsmart enough‚Äù to sort-out the music based on the current state of emotion the person is having. This project sets out to make an emotion recognition system, analyzing the current emotion and suggest a song accordingly.

* The two main parts of this program is to determine the emotion of the user using a front-camera/webcam and then sorting out the current playlist based on that emotion. It is developed in such a way that it can analyze the image properties and determine the mood of the user. The application also includes the facility of sorting songs based on mp3 file properties so that they can be added into appropriate playlists according to the mood.
